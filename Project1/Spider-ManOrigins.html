            <p class="p37">Beginnings of Peter Parker</p>
            <p class="p38">Queens, New York, Peter Parker was a high school student living with his Aunt May and Uncle Ben. He was presented as a clever but uncomfortable in social situations young guy who loved science.</p>
            <p class="p39">The Spider-Bite</p>
            <p class="p40">Peter's life dramatically changed after he saw a scientific fair that included radioactive spiders. He was bitten by a radioactive spider while at the exhibit, which gave him superhuman abilities. He quickly learned that he possessed a "spider-sense" that alerted him to danger, superhuman strength and agility, and the ability to attach to walls.</p>
            <p class="p41">Uncle Ben's Death</p>
            <p class="p42">When Peter Parker first developed superhuman abilities, he utilized them for financial gain by competing in a wrestling match. He didn't intervene to stop the thief, though, since he felt it wasn't his job. Tragically, the criminal later murdered Peter's Uncle Ben, instilling in him the important notion that "With great power comes great responsibility."
            <p class="p43">Becoming Spider-Man</p>
            <p class="p44">Peter created a red and blue outfit and adopted the identity of Spider-Man as a result of the passing of his uncle and his sense of duty. He battled several supervillains and criminals while hiding his identity by using his superpowers to fight crime.</p>

            <p class="p45">One of the most important life lessons Spider-Man has ever taught its fans is to always look out for family (which includes non-blood related individuals) and to never give up, alwyas keep your chin up no matter how tough something may seem. With the right mindset and enough work ethic and determination, anything can be possible.</p>
            <p class="p46">Another lesson Spider-Man has taught us is that it is okay to accept help sometimes. Though you may be someone who has a hard time accepting help from others, you are entitled to gaining support and having unconditional love and help from those who want to see you succeed.</p>
            <p class="p47">Lastly, Spider-Man has shown us what can happen when we don't think things through, even if we may have the right intentions. To be able to do something right and with the purest of hearts, you must be able to thing things through thouroughly and have have back-up plans. You must not be afraid to conquer your fears no matter how small they are, for example, asking for help.</p>
